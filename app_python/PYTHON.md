# Justification for Choosing FastAPI

- **High Performance**: FastAPI provides high performance due to its asynchronous support, making it one of the fastest web frameworks in the Python ecosystem.
- **Ease of Use**: Offers an intuitive design and automatic documentation generation, streamlining development and debugging processes.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Its built-in support for asynchronous request handling allows for efficient handling of numerous simultaneous connections.
- **Automatic Data Validation**: Uses Pydantic for automatic data validation, easing the parsing and validation of complex data and structures.
- **Developer Productivity**: Features like automatic API documentation (with Swagger UI and ReDoc) enhance developer productivity and facilitate a better development experience.
- **Strong Community and Documentation**: A growing community and comprehensive documentation aid in quick problem-solving and learning.

Choosing FastAPI leverages these advantages, ensuring the web application is efficient, maintainable, and scalable, while remaining within the Python ecosystem.

# Best Practices in FastAPI Web Application Development

## Best Practices Applied

- **Virtual Environments**: Utilized virtual environments to manage dependencies, ensuring that the application runs reliably in any deployment environment.
- **Dependency Management**: Maintained a concise `requirements.txt` file, listing all necessary dependencies explicitly to ensure reproducibility.
- **Testing**: Wrote automated test to make sure of the website is functioning as expected.
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Followed PEP 8 guidelines for Python code style to maintain readability and consistency across the codebase.
- **Type Annotations**: Used type annotations to improve code clarity and facilitate error detection at development time.
- **Docstrings**: Documented functions and classes using docstrings, providing clear explanations of their purpose and usage.
