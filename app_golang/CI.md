# Best Practices Overview

### Organizing Workflows into Distinct Jobs
To enhance readability and simplify maintenance, workflows are organized into separate jobs. This approach facilitates a modular design, allowing each job to focus on a specific task, thereby reducing complexity and improving the overall structure of the CI/CD pipeline.

### Structuring Jobs into Individual Steps
Further refining the organization, each job is broken down into distinct steps. This method enhances the documentation and clarity of the workflow, making it more accessible for updates and reviews. It delineates each action within a job, enabling precise control and easier troubleshooting.

### Implementing Caching Strategies
Caching is employed to increase efficiency and reduce build times. By caching dependencies and other frequently used data, the workflow minimizes redundant downloads and processing, leading to quicker execution times and more efficient use of resources.

### Optimizing Workflow Triggers
Workflow triggers are carefully configured to activate only for relevant changes. By monitoring specific paths, such as the `app_golang` directory (excluding markdown files), the workflow ensures that it runs only when necessary, conserving resources and avoiding unnecessary builds.

### Enhancing Visibility with Status Badges
To provide immediate insight into the build status, a status badge is integrated into the README of the application. This badge offers a quick visual indicator of the current build state, promoting transparency and immediate feedback.

### Incorporating Testing in the CI Pipeline
Testing is a critical component of the CI pipeline, ensuring that code changes are validated automatically with each push or pull request. This practice helps in identifying issues early, maintaining code quality, and ensuring reliability.

### Conducting Vulnerability Scans
To maintain security standards, vulnerability scanning through Snyk is incorporated into the workflow. This step identifies potential security issues before they can affect the production environment, emphasizing the importance of security within the development lifecycle.

### Enforcing Job Dependencies
The workflow is designed to enforce dependencies between jobs, ensuring that certain jobs, such as Docker image publishing, proceed only after previous jobs have completed successfully. This sequential job execution strategy prevents the progression of the pipeline in case of earlier failures, enhancing reliability and integrity.

### Secure Management of Sensitive Information
Sensitive information, including Docker Hub credentials and Snyk tokens, is securely managed through GitHub Secrets. This practice protects confidential data while allowing the CI/CD pipeline to access necessary resources, ensuring both security and functionality.
