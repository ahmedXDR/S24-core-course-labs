# Language Choice and Its Rationale

## Language: GoLang

**Rationale**: The decision to use GoLang for this project was driven by my interest in learning and experimenting with GoLang. I saw this project as an excellent opportunity to dive into GoLang, familiarizing myself with its syntax and features by developing a simple, functional application.

# Application Concept and Its Justification

## Idea: Moscow Time

**Justification**: As a beginner in GoLang, I aimed to start with a straightforward project that would allow me to focus on understanding the language and its core functionalities without getting overwhelmed. The Moscow Time app served as an ideal starting point, offering a manageable scope that emphasized learning through doing. It was a way to apply basic GoLang concepts in a real-world scenario, enhancing my comprehension and skills in a practical manner.

# Adherence to Best Practices

## Minimalism

- **Approach**: The codebase is intentionally kept concise and focused, eliminating unnecessary complexity. This approach minimizes the risk of errors and streamlines the development process, making the code easier to read and maintain.

## Error Handling

- **Implementation**: Error handling is a critical aspect of the application, particularly in functions like `time.LoadLocation`. Errors are carefully checked, and appropriate responses are generated using `http.Error` to inform the client of any issues with a meaningful message and HTTP status code.

## Testing

- **Strategy**: A test has been written for the HTTP handler function to verify that it returns the expected status code and response body. This ensures that the application behaves as intended under various conditions.

## Convention and Structure

- **Practice**: The project adheres to Go's established naming conventions and follows the standard pattern for implementing HTTP servers in Go. This consistency aids in readability and maintainability, making it easier for others familiar with Go to understand and contribute to the project.

## Comments

- **Usage**: Comments are utilized throughout the code to clarify the purpose and functionality of different sections. This not only aids in my understanding as I learn GoLang but also makes the code more accessible to others by explaining how and why certain decisions were made.

## README

- **Purpose**: A comprehensive README.md file has been created to guide users through the project setup, execution, and testing. It serves as an introductory document, offering insights into the project's goals, structure, and how to interact with it effectively.
